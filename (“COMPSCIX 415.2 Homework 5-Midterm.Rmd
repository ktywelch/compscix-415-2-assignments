This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
?tidyverse

```
# 1
Can you name which package is associated with each task below?
Plotting -
Data munging/wrangling -  dpylr
Reshaping (speading and gathering) data - ggplot2  
Importing/exporting data - readr

#2. Now can you name two functions that you’ve used from each package that you listed above for these
tasks?
Plotting -
Data munging/wrangling - select, filter, mutate
Reshaping data - aes, geom_point
Importing/exporting data (note that readRDS and saveRDS are base R functions) - read_delim, read_csv

## R Basics (1.5 points)
#1. Fix this code with the fewest number of changes possible so it works:
Removed ! 
```{r}
My_data.name___is.too00ooLong <- c( 1 , 2 , 3 )

```

#2. Fix this code so it works:
Changed to lower case c (synatx) added ' to end of data
```{r}
my_string <- c('has', 'an', 'error', 'in', 'it')
```


#3. Look at the code below and comment on what happened to the values in the vector.
They become string values 
```{r}
my_vector <- c(1, 2, '3', '4', 5)
my_vector
```

##Data import/export (3 points)
#1. Download the rail_trail.txt file from Canvas (in the Midterm Exam section here) and successfully
import it into R. Prove that it was imported successfully by including your import code and taking a
glimpse of the result.
```{r}

weather <- read_delim("/Users/kwelch/DataSciClass/Homework1/rail_trail.txt",delim = "|",col_names = TRUE)
glimpse(weather)
```

#2. Export the file into an R-specific format and name it “rail_trail.rds”. Make sure you define the path

correctly so that you know where it gets saved. Then reload the file. Include your export and import
code and take another glimpse.
Visualization (6 points)
```{r}

write_rds(weather,"/Users/kwelch/DataSciClass/Homework1/rail_trail.rds")

weather2 <- read_rds("/Users/kwelch/DataSciClass/Homework1/rail_trail.rds")
glimpse(weather2)

```

#1. Critique this graphic: give only three examples of what is wrong with this graphic. Be concise.
It is hard to understand the message in the graph:
None of the the apparently related circles add up to 100%
There are three categories that use the same color - doesn't make sense.
In all instances the yes and no are the same color and the big little circle doesn't really send a clear message.


#2. Reproduce this graphic using the diamonds data set.
```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds, mapping = aes(cut,carat,fill=color)) +
geom_boxplot() +
coord_flip()+
xlab("CARAT OF DIAMOND") +
ylab("CUT OF DIAMOND")

```

#3. The previous graphic is not very useful. We can make it much more useful by changing one thing about
Could not reproduce graph but this on is more useful because it gives more detail 


#1. Is this data “tidy”? If yes, leave it alone and go to the next problem. If no, make it tidy. Note: this

No the data it is spreading not tidy it shoudl have Country, year, cases, popluation headers.


```{r}
library(tidyverse)

table2
t2a <- spread(table2, key = type, value = count)

t2a



```

#2. Create a new column in the diamonds data set called price_per_carat that shows the price of each
diamond per carat (hint: divide). Only show me the code, not the output.

```{r}
mutate(diamonds, price_per_carat = price/carat)
```


#3. For each cut of diamond in the diamonds data set, how many diamonds, and what proportion, have a
#  price > 10000 and a carat < 1.5? 
5222 over 10000
4018 > 1.5 carat

cut count
-----------
Fair	127			
Good	309			
Very Good	861			
Premium	1509			
Ideal	1212	

cut  numc  prop
---------------
Fair	127	3%		
Good	309	8%		
Very Good	861	21%		
Premium	1509	38%		
Ideal	1212	30%

There are several ways to get to an answer, but your solution must
use the data wrangling verbs from the tidyverse in order to get credit.
• Do the results make sense? Why?
• Do we need to be wary of any of these numbers? 
Yes
Why?
In this case they don't really tell us the carat or the quality just price and cut
*** got the mutate idea help from stack overflow
```{r}

diamonds %>% filter(price>10000) %>%
filter(carat > 1.5) %>% group_by(cut) %>% 
summarise (numc=n()) %>%
mutate(prop = paste0(round(100 * numc/sum(numc), 0), "%"))

```

EDA (6 points)
#Take a look at the txhousing data set that is included with the ggplot2 package and answer these questions:
```{r}
glimpse(txhousing)

```

1. During what time period is this data from?

2. How many cities are represented?
3. Which city, month and year had the highest number of sales?
4. What kind of relationship do you think exists between the number of listings and the number of sales?
Check your assumption and show your work.
5. What proportion of sales is missing for each city?
6. Looking at only the cities and months with greater than 500 sales:
• Are the distributions of the median sales price (column name median), when grouped by city,
different? The same? Show your work.
• Any cities that stand out that you’d want to investigate further?
• Why might we want to filter out all cities and months with sales less than 500?
Git and Github (1.5 points)
To demonstrate your use of git and Github, at the top of your document put a hyperlink to your Github
repository.
